# Diabetes-Dataset-EDA

This repository contains a dataset related to diabetes, along with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebook that provides insights into the dataset.

## Dataset Information

This is one of the most famous diabetes dataset used in machine learning and data analysis called "Pima Indians Diabetes Database". This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective is to predict based on diagnostic measurements whether a patient has diabetes. The dataset contains 768 samples and 9 attributes.

- **Pregnancies**: This column tells us how many times a patient has been pregnant.
- **Glucose**: This column measures the patient's blood sugar level after consuming glucose.
- **BloodPressure**: This column represents the patient's blood pressure reading, specifically the pressure in the arteries when the heart is at rest. (mm Hg)
- **SkinThickness**: This column indicates the thickness of the skinfold on the triceps (mm).
- **Insulin**: This column shows the level of insulin in the patient's blood after a 2-hour period. ((mu U/ml))
- **BMI**: This column represents the patient's Body Mass Index, which is a measure of body fat based on height and weight.
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: This column measures the patient's likelihood of having diabetes based on their family history of the disease.
- **Age**: This column tells us the age of the patient in years.
- **Outcome**: This column indicates whether the patient has diabetes or not. A value of 1 means they have diabetes, while 0 means they don't.

## EDA Notebook

The EDA notebook in this repository explores the diabetes dataset in depth. It performs statistical analysis, visualizations, and data preprocessing to uncover relationships and insights. The notebook provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the analysis and aims to answer questions such as:

- What are the distributions of different attributes in the dataset?
- Are there any correlations between the attributes?
- How does each attribute contribute to the risk of diabetes?
- Are there any outliers or missing values that need to be addressed?
